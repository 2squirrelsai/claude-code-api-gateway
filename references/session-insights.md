## Integration Checklist

When reviewing insights for integration:

1. **Is it reproducible?** - Will this issue occur again in similar contexts?
2. **Is it generalizable?** - Does this apply beyond this specific project?
3. **Is it actionable?** - Can it be turned into a clear pattern or checklist item?
4. **Where does it belong?** - Which phase reference should include it?
